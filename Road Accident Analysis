Road Accident Analysis Dashboard🌟

Proud to share my latest data analysis project, where I created an interactive dashboard to analyze road accident data and uncover actionable insights! Using Excel, this dashboard visualizes critical aspects of road safety and provides a foundation for data-driven decision-making.
🔍 Key Features:
1️⃣ Accident Trends Over Time - Highlights monthly accident patterns to identify high-risk periods.
2️⃣ Accidents by Road Type and Severity - Evaluates accident severity across different road types, focusing on single carriageways.
3️⃣ Impact of Weather Conditions - Reveals how weather factors like fog and rain contribute to accidents.
4️⃣ Accidents by Day of the Week - Identifies weekdays with higher accident rates to guide preventive measures.
5️⃣ Accident Locations - Showcases accident-prone areas for targeted interventions.
6️⃣ Casualties vs. Vehicles Scatter Plot - Analyzes the relationship between the number of vehicles involved and casualties.
🎯 Key Insights:
Single carriageways account for a significant share of accidents, calling for better road infrastructure and safety measures.
Adverse weather conditions (fog, rain) increase accident risks, highlighting the importance of driver awareness campaigns.
Peak accidents occur on Fridays, emphasizing the need for increased traffic monitoring during the weekend rush.
📈 Conclusion:
This analysis provides valuable insights to help policymakers, urban planners, and safety departments reduce accidents and save lives. By focusing on infrastructure improvement, driver education, and timely interventions, we can make urban roads safer for everyone.
